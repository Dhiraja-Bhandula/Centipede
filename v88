//Coded by Angelo Regec and Eric Unangst (Contact via Twitter @Unangst.)
//Summary: A simple to use, easy to modify version of Centipede we use to quickly enterprise enroll new Chromebooks.
//When running, this code takes about 3:10 to automatically onboard one device.  (1:40 or as little as 1:04 is the 'wait time' to check for Chrome updates.)
//Inspiration - http://labs.amplifiedit.com/centipede  (We shifted away from this code as it's 30+ versions behind.

//Coded to run on Arduino Pro Micros.
//Known working on HP 11A G8 EE Chromebooks. 6/21/21.
//Known working on Chrome OS v.88. 6/22/21.

//Save a copy of this text file as... Chromebook_v88.ino... and head on over to your Ardunio editor of choice... (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
//**IMPORTANT** Before pushing code out, go to Tools -> Board: and make sure it is select your Arduino version (we use Arduino Micros). 
//Additionally, make sure that the COM port that you selected is the one that the Arduino is actually connected to. =) **IMPORTANT** 

//To make this code work, you'll need to update the code below in four places with the following info:
//1. Your SSID
//2. Your wifi password 
//3. The email address you use for setup
//4. The password you use for this setup

#include <Keyboard.h> //necessary for keyboard functionality
#define KEY_TAB         0xB3 //these specify the data values of the keys used and define them to be used in the keyboar.write() and keyboard.press() functions
#define KEY_ENTER       0xB0
#define KEY_DOWN_ARROW  0xD9
#define KEY_RIGHT_CTRL  0x84
#define KEY_LEFT_ALT    0x82

/*Keyboard.write() presses a button/key and releases it like you were typing on a keyboard
 *Keyboard.press() presses and holds a button/key and Keyboard.releaseAll() releases the button/key
 *Keyboard.print() enters the string of your choosing. make sure you use "
 *wait() is a function found at the bottom of the code. necessary for wait() to work
